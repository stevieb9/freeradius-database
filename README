FreeRADIUS-Database version 0.0.2
=======================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL     
   
   # manual intervention is required during this step to
   # provide the user the ability to specify alternate
   # directory information
   
   make
   make test
   make install

   # if you want to install the utilities

   make scripts 



NOTES

- This distribution comes with a few management scripts that automate
radacct grouping and aggregation tasks that aid in both database
maintenance and UBB-type tasks

- The configuration file will be installed into the directory you specified 
during 'perl Makefile.PL' stage, or /usr/local/etc by default.

You will need to rename the configuration file from freeradius_database.conf-dist 
to freeradius_database.conf, and then set the config variables to suit your needs.

The configuration file has its own documentation. See

   perldoc FreeRADIUS::freeradius_database.conf 

- Currently, only MySQL has been used in production. The tests use
a dedicated SQLite database.



DATABASE SCHEMA

The daily and monthly aggregation routines require their own
database tables, currently within the actual RADIUS database, and
are for MySQL only.

The schema files are located in src/schema. To implement:

   mysql -u user -p [-h host] radius_db < src/schema/aggregate_daily.sql
   mysql -u user -p [-h host] radius_db < src/schema/aggregate_monthly.sql

... you'd be well advised to make a backup of your RADIUS database first.

  

ACCOMPANYING SCRIPTS

There are a few accompanying scripts with this module so you can
get up and running as soon as possible.

Refer to the documentation of these scripts to get a full
understanding of their purpose and usage:

   perldoc aggregate_daily
   perldoc aggregate_monthly
   perldoc update_nas_ip_address
   perldoc archive_radacct

aggregate_daily, aggregate_monthly, and archive_radacct are
designed to be run from cron.

aggregate_daily should be run after midnight, with aggregate_monthly
following the completion of the daily script. It may be prudent
to chain the commands into a single cron entry to ensure
that daily completes prior to the monthly script running.  



DEPENDENCIES

See the Makefile.PL file.
